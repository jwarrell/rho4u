\section{Introduction and motivation}

In \cite{arxiv:meta-metta-opsem:meredith} we described a register
machine based operational semantics for $\mathsf{MeTTa}$. While this
has some utility for proving the correctness of compilers, it is not
conducive for reasoning about types and other more abstract aspects of
$\mathsf{MeTTa}$-based computation. Here we present a calculus,
together with a efficient implementation and prove the correctness of
the implementation.

Additionally, we use the $\mathsf{OSLF}$ algorithm developed by
Meredith, Stay, and Williams to calculate a spatial-behavioral type
system for $\mathsf{MeTTa}$. Further, we adapt a well known procedure
for proving the termination of rewrites to provide a token-based
security model for the calculus and implementation.
