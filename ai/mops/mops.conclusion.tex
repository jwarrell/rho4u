\section{Conclusion and future work}

We have presented two versions of the operational semantics for MeTTa, one that is fit for private implementations that have some external security model, and one that is fit for running in a decentralized setting.

This semantics does not addressed typed versions of MeTTa. An interesting avenue of approach is the apply Meredith and Stay's OSLF to this semantics to derive a type system for MeTTa that includes spatial and behavioral types.
