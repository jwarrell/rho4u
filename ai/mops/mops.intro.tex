\section{Introduction and motivation}
We present the operational semantics for the language MeTTa. MeTTa is designed as a language in which humans and AGIs write the behavior of AGIs, being jointly developed by SingularityNet.io and F1R3FLY.io, as part of SingularityNet.io's OpenCog and Hyperon projects \cite{DBLP:conf/agi/HartG08} \cite{YT:GoertzelIklePotapovHyperon2022}. One of the principle motivations of this document is to help developers of MeTTa clients know what is a correct and compliant implementation. The document serves roughly the same function as the JVM specification or Ethereum's Yellow paper \cite{wood2014ethereum}.
