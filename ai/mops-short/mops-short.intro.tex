\section{Introduction and motivation}
We present joint work between SingularityNet.io and F1R3FLY.io. As part of their OpenCog and Hyperon projects SingularityNet.io \cite{DBLP:conf/agi/HartG08} \cite{YT:GoertzelIklePotapovHyperon2022} has developed the language MeTTa in which humans and AGIs codify the behavior of AGIs. F1R3FLY.io is providing a compilation from MeTTa to rholang, a highly concurrent language, based on the rho-calculus, designed for high throughput and scalable transaction servers \cite{GH:MeredithRChainRholang} \cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/MeredithR05}.

To facilitate a correct compilation, both teams have developed a formal operational semantics for MeTTa. Here we summarize the semantics and the methodology used to develop it and demonstrate how it facilitates a provably correct compilation into rholang.
