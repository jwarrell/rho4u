\section{Introduction and motivation}
We present joint work between SingularityNet.io and F1R3FLY.io. As part of their OpenCog and Hyperon projects SingularityNet.io has developed the language MeTTa in which humans and AGIs codify the behavior of AGIs. F1R3FLY.io is providing a compilation from MeTTa to rholang, a highly concurrent language designed for high throughput and scalable transaction servers.

To facilitate a correct compilation, both teams have developed a formal operational semantics for the language. Here we summarize the semantics and the methodology used to develop it and demonstrate how it facilitates a provably correct compilation into rholang.
