\section{Introduction and motivation}
We present the operational semantics for the language MeTTa. MeTTa is designed as a language in which humans and AGIs write the behavior of AGIs. One of the principle motivations of this document is to help developers of MeTTa clients know what is a correct and compliant implementation. The document serves roughly the same function as the JVM specification or Ethereum's Yellow paper.
