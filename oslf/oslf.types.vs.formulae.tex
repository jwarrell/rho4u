\section{The difference between types and formulae}

In this paper we differentiate between types and formulae. In
particular, what the paper on the native type theory construction
refers to by the word type is not the same was what is typically in
the programming language semantics community. Formulae are model
checked. That is, when someone writes $t \models \phi$, we take them
to mean $\meaningof{t} \in \meaningof{\phi}$. Native type theory is
effectively still squarely in the model checking camp.

Types come with a notion of type checking that provides an algorithmic
correspondence between the proof that a give term inhabits a type with
the structure of the term.
