\section{Main theorem: substitutability}
The Liskov substitutability principle is vitally important for a type
systems, especially if we want our type system to provide guidance for
automated refactoring and other kinds of support we might expect of a
type-directed interactive design environment, such as IntelliJ or
Eclipse. In Milner's polyadic $\pi$-calculus tutorial he demonstrates
exactly the sort of theorem for his logic that we need to formalize
Liskov's principle.

\begin{mathpar}
  P \wbbisim Q \iff \forall \phi.( P \vDash \phi \iff Q \vDash \phi)
\end{mathpar}

As Caires points out, spatial connectives can see structural
properties that Milner's logic cannot. In particular, bisimulation
cannot distinguish parallel composition from the summ of all
interleavings. Fortunately, by including proved versions of the
structural equalities we recover Milner's theorem.

\begin{theorem}[substitutability]
  \begin{mathpar}
    P \wbbisim Q \iff \forall (\mathbf{U},\mathbf{X}).( P : (\mathbf{U},\mathbf{X}) \iff Q : (\mathbf{U},\mathbf{X}))
  \end{mathpar}
\end{theorem}
