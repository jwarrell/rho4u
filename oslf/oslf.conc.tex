\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have presented an algorithm for generating a spatial-behavioral
type system for a model of computation.

\subsection{Features of the topos we have yet to address}
Dependent and parametric types.

\subsection{Stochastic and quantum variations}

One of the most important discoveries of process calculi -- as models
of computation -- is that they can abstractly describe
non-deterministic behavior and leave to implementation the
\emph{source of that non-determinism}. Thus, for the rho-calculus
non-determism can be actual races derived from message arrival order
non-determinism over physically implemented protocols, or it can be
from a 1-norm probability distribution, or as recently discovered, it
can be from a 2-norm probability distribution.

These last two cases are important as they extend the models to
simulating and potentially programming physical substrates including
chemical and biological computation as well as quantum computation. In
the same way that Hennessey-Milner style logics have been extended to
the stochastic and quantum settings, we believe that this algorithm
can be extended to cover these cases.
