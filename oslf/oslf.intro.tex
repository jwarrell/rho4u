\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction} % (fold)

Programmers who work on large scale deployments, like Facebook,
Google, or Microsoft services, know that it is just not cost effective
to write code at scale in an untyped language. Why waste human time
and effort on writing tests (and debugging them) and worrying about
coverage for cases that a compiler can completely and exhaustively
automate? That is why the big three (Facebook, Google, and Microsoft)
all spent tens of millions of dollars each developing typed versions
of javascript. It's cheaper than continuing to throw good money
after bad on commercial development in at industrial scale in an
untyped language. All told, the cost to the industry of this one issue
alone is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

But, as we move deeper and deeper into the era of distributed
concurrent computing, the sorts of errors that mainstream programming
languages catch with their type systems are only the tip of the
iceberg. The Java type system cannot catch liveness errors. The Rust
type system cannot catch security errors. However, the programming
language semantics community has known for 30 years about techniques
for catching a much wider range of safety and liveness errors. Session
types, spatial and behavioral types are well explored areas bearing
considerable fruit on just these sorts of issues. And, just like with
javascript, it is taking the community ages to get these techniques
into the hands of front line developers.

What if it didn't have to be this way? What if the type system for
spatial and behavioral types could be algorithmically generated from
the specification of the programming language? That's what this paper
is about: an algorithm that takes as input a description of a model of
computation as a rewrite system and \emph{generates} as output a
spatial-behavioral type system for the model.
