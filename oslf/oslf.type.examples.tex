\subsection{Function types}

Recall the types of the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus.

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {T[G] ::= G \; |\; T[G] \Rightarrow T[G]}
\end{mathpar}

How would these be interpreted in our system, which does not presume
functions as part of the input model of computation?

There are, in fact, two semantics available. One, of course, it what
is provided by the topos. Another, less immediately obvious, is what
is provided by the modal operators.

In light of the work to internalize the type constructors, it is worth
asking about the relationship between the witnesses of the
internalized function types and the modal types that interpret
function types. We argue that for coherence witnesses must be weakly
bisimilar.
