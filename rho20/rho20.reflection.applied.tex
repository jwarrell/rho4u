\section{Applied reflection: Reflective set theory and reflective graphs}
In this section we illustrate, albeit briefly, that reflection has a
much wider utility than just computation. We describe reflective
versions of set theory and graph theory and illustrate via some core
examples how reflection accounts for an interesting range of phenomena.

\subsection{Reflective set theory}

This presentation will be just a sketch. A more rigorous formal
account is most likely built using Awodey's algebraic set theory.

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* [lab=red-set] {} {\textcolor{red}{\mathsf{S}}[A] \bc \textcolor{red}{\bold{\mathsf{\{}}} (A \bm \textcolor{red}{\mathsf{S}}[A])^{*} \textcolor{red}{\bold{\mathsf{\}}}}}
  \and
  \inferrule* [lab=black-set] {} {\mathsf{S}[A] \bc \bold{\mathsf{\{}} (A \bm \mathsf{S}[A])^{*} \bold{\mathsf{\}}}} \\
  \and
  \inferrule* [lab=rset-player] {} {\mathsf{RSet}_{player} = \textcolor{red}{\mathsf{S}}[\mathsf{S}[\mathsf{RSet}_{player}]]}
  \and
  \inferrule* [lab=rset-opponent] {} {\mathsf{RSet}_{opponent} = \mathsf{S}[\textcolor{red}{\mathsf{S}}[\mathsf{RSet}_{opponent}]]}
  \and
  \inferrule* [lab=rset] {} {\mathsf{RSet} = \mathsf{RSet}_{player} \oplus \mathsf{RSet}_{opponent}}
\end{mathpar}

The intuition is that we have two distinct \emph{copies} of set
theory, which we will denote for purposes of discussion, red set
theory and black set theory. Both of these theories are considered
parametric in a theory of atoms. Thus, these theories are instances of
a Fraenkl-Mostowski set theory ($\mathsf{FM}$ set theory). But, now we
make the atoms of the red set theory be black sets, and the atoms of
the black set theory be red sets.

Again, computer science provides a unique perspective on these age old
notions. The idea of copies of a theory comes about when we reify meta
theory as theory, something implicit in Awodey's work. Computer
science also provides a very practical means for realizing it: we have
different constructors (red braces versus black braces); and different
accessor (a red element-of operation versus a black element of
operation). Further, computer science is quite comfortable with these
kinds of mutually recursive structures. The mutual recursion bottoms
out in the red empty set and the black empty set.

What motivates such a strange construction? It turns out that
$\mathsf{FM}$ set theory has been successfully applied to reasoning
about nominal phenomena, such as binders in the $\pi$-calculus. But,
once again, one is left with a dissatisfying theory of atoms without
structure. This theory explains where atoms come from and how they can
have exactly the same structure as sets. In other words, it reconciles
$\mathsf{FM}$ set theory with $\mathsf{ZF}$ set theory.

\subsection{Reflective graphs}

\subsection{Well-formedness}

This is an algebraic theory, and thus it is syntactic in nature. It
provides a language of graphs that are built out of logical sentences.
In more detail, the theory admits three kinds of sentences:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  recognizing an admissible vertex:
  \(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash v\);
\item
  recognizing an admissible variable:
  \(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash x\);
\item
  and, recognizing a well formed graph:
  \(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash g\)
\end{itemize}

Variables are used to capture references to vertices which are in turn
used to form edges between vertices. As such, judging the wellformedness
of a graph depends on the use of references. Hence, a judgement makes
use of a dependency list, \(\Gamma\) which is just a sequence of
variables. That is,

\[\Gamma ::= () \;|\; x, \Gamma\]

Notationally, we overload the comma to indicate concatenation of
sequences. Thus, given \(\Gamma_1 = x_{11},\ldots,x_{1m}\) and
\(\Gamma_2 = x_{21},\ldots,x_{2n}\), then
\(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 = x_{11},\ldots,x_{1m},x_{21},\ldots,x_{2n}\)

A graph expression is given by the grammar

\[g,h ::= 0 \;|\; v|g \;|\; x|g \;|\; g \otimes h \; |\;\mathsf{let}\; x = v \; \mathsf{in}\; g \;|\; \langle \mathsf{let}\; x_1 = v_1 \; \mathsf{in}\; g, \mathsf{let}\; x_2 = v_2 \; \mathsf{in}\; h\rangle\]

\hypertarget{pronunciation}{%
\subsubsection{Pronunciation}\label{pronunciation}}

The graph constructors are pronounced as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(0\) -- ``the empty graph'', or just ``empty'';
\item
  \(v | g\) -- ``\(g\) with the vertex \(v\) adjoined'', or ``adjoin
  \(v\) to \(g\)'';
\item
  \(g_1 \otimes g_2\) -- ``the graph formed by juxtaposing \(g_1\) and
  \(g_2\)'', or ``juxtapose \(g_1\) and \(g_2\)'', or just ``\(g_1\) and
  \(g_2\)'';
\item
  \(\mathsf{let}\; x = v \; \mathsf{in}\; g\) -- ``let \(x\) stand for
  \(v\) in \(g\)''; or ``let \(x\) be \(v\) in \(g\)'';
\item
  \(\langle \mathsf{let}\; x_1 = v_1 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_1,\mathsf{let}\; x_2 = v_2 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_2\rangle\)
  -- ``the graph formed by connecting \(g_1\) to \(g_2\) with and edge
  from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\)''; or, ``connect \(g_1\) to \(g_2\) with and
  edge from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\)''.
\end{itemize}

We say $x$ is fresh in $g$ if $x$ does not occur in $g$.

The judgment \(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash g\) is pronounced
``\(\mathsf{G}[X,V]\) thinks that \(g\) is well-formed, given
dependencies, \(\Gamma\) .'' Similarly,
\(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash v\) is pronounced ``\(\mathsf{G}[X,V]\)
thinks that \(v\) is an admissible vertex, given dependencies,
\(\Gamma\);'' and \(\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash x\) is pronounced
``\(\mathsf{G}[X,V]\) thinks that \(x\) is an admissible variable, given
dependencies, \(\Gamma\).''

A rule of the form

\[\frac{ H_1, \ldots , H_n }{ C }R\]

is pronounced ``\(R\) concludes that \(C\) given \(H_1\), \(\ldots\),
\(H_n\)''.

The rules for judging when a vertex or a variable are admissible or
graph is well formed are as follows

\[\frac{ }{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; () \vdash 0}Foundation\]

\[\frac{ v \in V }{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; () \vdash v}Verticity \;\;\frac{ x \in X }{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \emptyset \vdash x}Variation\]

\[\frac{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash g \;\; \mathsf{G}[X,V]; () \vdash v }{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash v | g}Participation \; \; \frac{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash g \;\; \mathsf{G}[X,V]; () \vdash x }{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma, x \vdash x | g}Dependence\]

\[\frac{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_1 \vdash g_1 \; \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_2 \vdash g_2}{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash g_1 \otimes g_2}Juxtaposition[\Gamma_1 \cap \Gamma_2 = \emptyset]\]

\[\frac{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma,x \vdash v|g}{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma \vdash \mathsf{let}\; x = v \; \mathsf{in}\; g}Nomination[x \;fresh\; in\; g]\]

\[\frac{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_1 \vdash \mathsf{let}\; x_1 = v_1 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_1 \; \;\mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_2 \vdash \mathsf{let}\; x_2 = v_2 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_2}{ \mathsf{G}[X,V]; \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \vdash \langle \mathsf{let}\; x_1 = v_1 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_1, \mathsf{let}\; x_2 = v_2 \; \mathsf{in}\; g_2 \rangle}Connection[\Gamma_1 \cap \Gamma_2 = \emptyset]\]
