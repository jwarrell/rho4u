\section{From formalism to physical intuition and back}
The guiding intuition is that information about a physical entity must
be present at a name. To model the non-deterministic character of
quantum mechanics the information and its variants are spread out over
a collection of names, i.e. a namespace, $\quotep{\phi}$. In symbols,
we represent the possible states of a physical entity, like the spin
of a particle, as expressions of the form

\begin{mathpar}
  S = \Sigma_{u \in \quotep{\phi}, {s \in S}}\outputp{u}{Q_{s}}
\end{mathpar}

We represent a test for a property as input at a name.

\begin{mathpar}
  T = \Sigma_{u \in \quotep{\phi}, {c \in C}}\prefix{u}{v}{P_{c}}
\end{mathpar}

Then a measurement at a specific name, $x$, is given by

\begin{mathpar}
  \testnp{T}{x}{S} = x \cdot (T^{\bot}[S]) = x \cdot (T|S)
\end{mathpar}
