\section{Stern-Gerlach again}
This is where we have some real fun. Stern-Gerlach was one of a host
of experiments being developed around the first third of the previous
century that gave rise to quantum mechanics. Modeling Stern-Gerlach is
seen as one of the tests of quantum mechanical theory.

Here's the Wikipedia link describing the experimental set up and
relevance to the development of quantum mechanics:
