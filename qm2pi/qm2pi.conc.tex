\section{Conclusions and future work}

One way to understand the rho-calculus is a study in the seams of the $\pi$-calculus. There are several holes in Milner's calculus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{the zero process}, $\pzero$, is an input to the theory; adding other elements here corresponds to supplying ``builtin'' processes;
  \item \emph{names} are an input to the theory, which we discussed at length;
  \item \emph{the source of non-determinism} is an input to the theory.
\end{itemize}

The results here can really be seen as an initial exploration of the a general theory of this third dependency.
